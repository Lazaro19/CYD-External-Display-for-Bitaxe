## What's new in Version 2.0: Swipe functionality and multiple layouts

This updated version supports three different layouts. 
You can change the layout by swiping from the middle of the screen to the right, or go back to the previous layout by swiping from the middle to the left.

## What's new in Version 2.0: Achievements feature

If you unlock an achievement, you will see a small celebration screen, which you can close by tapping it.

You can access the achievements page, where you can check your unlocked achievements, by swiping right from Layout 3 and go back by swiping left.

Pressing and holding an achievement will show a brief explanation of why you unlocked it.

Can you unlock every achievement?! (I hope not; thereâ€™s an overheating one! xD)

To reset your achievements:

- Download the sketch Reset_Achievements and place it in your Arduino folder where your sketches are.

- When you open the sketch, Arduino will create a folder for it.

- Select `ESP32 DEV Module` and the correct `COM` and upload the sketch.

- After uploading, re-upload the Bitaxe_Monitor sketch.

- Your achievements will now be reset.



# Bitaxe Monitor Project - Build Guide

This guide provides simple instructions to build and deploy the Bitaxe Monitor project, a custom UI for monitoring Bitcoin mining hardware (Bitaxe) on a CYD 2432S028R board using an ESP32 microcontroller.

## Prerequisites

- **Hardware**:
  - CYD 2432S028R board (ESP32-based with a 320x240 TFT display)
  - USB cable
  - Bitaxe mining hardware (connected to your local network)
- **Software**:
  - Arduino IDE
- **Network**:
  - Wi-Fi credentials
  - IP address of your Bitaxe device on your local network

## Step 1: Set Up the Arduino IDE

1. **Install ESP32 Board Support**:
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Go to `Tools` > `Board` > `Boards Manager`, search for `ESP32`, and install the package by Espressif Systems.
2. **Select Board and Configure Settings**:
   - Under `Tools` > `Board` > `ESP32`, select `ESP32 Dev Module`.
   - Select the correct COM port
   - Under `Tools`, configure:
     - `PSRAM` to `Enabled`
     - `Partition Scheme` to `Huge APP (3MB No OTA / 1MB SPIFFS) `

## Step 2: Install Required Libraries

1. Go to `Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Manage Libraries...`.
2. Search for and install the following libraries:
   - `TFT_eSPI` by Bodmer
   - `lvgl` by kisvegabor (version 8.3.11)
   - `WiFi` (usually included)
   - `HTTPClient` (usually included)
   - `ArduinoJson` by Benoit Blanchon
   - `XPT2046_Touchscreen` by Paul Stoffregen
   - `Preferences` (usually included)
   - `SPI` (usually included)

## Step 3: Download and Open the Project

1. **Download the Project Files**:
   - download the `Bitaxe_Monitor.ino`, `background.c`, `background.h`, `User_Setup.h`, `lv_conf.h`,`background2.c`, `background2.h`,`background3.c`, `background3.h`,`backgroundachieve.c`, `backgroundachieve.h`,`achievementpopup.c`and `achievementpopup.h` files. (`reset_achievements` is optional)
2. **Place Configuration Files in Correct Folders**:
   - Place `User_Setup.h` in the `TFT_eSPI` library folder (`Documents\Arduino\libraries\TFT_eSPI`).
   - Place `lv_conf.h` in the libraries folder (`Documents\Arduino\libraries\`).
   - Keep all other files in the same folder as the `.ino` file. (e.g., `Documents\Arduino\Bitaxe_Monitor`)
3. **Open the Sketch**:
   - In the Arduino IDE, go to `File` > `Open` and select the `Bitaxe_Monitor.ino` file.

## Step 4: Configure the Sketch

Before compiling, update the network settings to match your environment.

1. In the Arduino IDE, locate the following lines near the top of the sketch code:

    ```
    ssid = "YourWifiName";
    pwd = "YourWifiPW";
    bitaxe_url = "http://YourBitaxeIp/api/system/info";
    ```

2. Update these values:
    - `ssid`: Your Wi-Fi network name (replace `YourWifiName` with your actual Wi-Fi SSID).
    - `pwd`: Your Wi-Fi password (replace `YourWifiPW` with your actual Wi-Fi password).
    - `bitaxe_url`: The IP address of your Bitaxe device on your local network (replace `YourBitaxeIp` with the actual IP address of your Bitaxe, e.g., `http://192.168.1.100/api/system/info`).

## Step 5: Compile and Upload the Sketch

1. Connect your CYD 2432S028R board via USB.
2. In the Arduino IDE, click `Sketch` > `Verify/Compile` to check for errors.
3. If successful, click `Sketch` > `Upload` to upload the code to your board. If necessary, hold the `BOOT` button then press `RESET` and then release the `BOOT` Button on the board during upload.


## Troubleshooting

- **Compilation Errors**:
  - Are all required libraries installed as described above?
  - Is `User_Setup.h` in the `TFT_eSPI` folder, `lv_conf.h` in the libraries folder, and all `backgroundXXX.c/.h` in the sketch folder?
- **Wi-Fi Connection Issues**:
  - Are the SSID and password correct?
  - Is the board within range of your Wi-Fi network?
- **No Data from Bitaxe**:
  - Is the IP address in the sketch correct?
  - Is the Bitaxe device online and accessible on your network?
- **No COM Port Visible**:
  - Check the Device Manager. If needed, install the CP210x driver.
- **Performance or Memory Issues**:
  - Set PSRAM to `Enabled` and Partition Scheme to `HUGE APP`.
- **Display Issues**:
  - if your Display looks all scrambled up, search with Crtl + F for rotation (`TFT` not `Touch`) and replace the 2 with 1 or 3. Some CYD use a different screen rotation.
  - if your Display doesnt recognise the right touch points (eg. clicking on achievements), search with Crtl + F for rotation (`Touch` not `TFT`) and replace the 1 with 0 or 2. Some CYD use a different touch rotation.
  - if your Display is inverted (blue), open the User_Setup.h with editor and search for #define TFT_RGB_ORDER TFT_RGB and change it to TFT_BGR.
